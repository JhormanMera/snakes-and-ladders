# Snakes And Ladders 

Snakes and Ladders is a console text program developed in the Java language, inspired by the game well known around the world, which bears the same name as this project. The game has a grid containing 'n' rows and 'm' columns, within which there are s snakes and e ladders and 'p' players.

The objective of the game is for a player to reach the end of the grid in order to win and be added to the winners table, but this work will not be entirely easy, since obstacles such as the 'snakes' which will drop down to a square below the player when he touches his head. In turn, there are aids such as the 'stairs' which will go up to a square higher than the player when he touches the base of this.

Dare to enjoy this fun experience called Snakes and Ladders :)
